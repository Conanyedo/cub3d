##Cub3d

First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).

#How to run it

Using make bonus will build the executable and run it.

To run it again without remaking, you can simply run the executable with ./cub3D.

#Controls
  *You can move around the maze with W A S D.

  *You can also rotate the view with the directional arrows ← and →.

  *You can shoot with SPACE.

To exit the game, press ESC or click the red cross.

#The mandatory part

The basic program that was required to pass. It only includes wall textures and a sprite ; no floor/ceiling textures, no weapons, no enemies, no game elements at all.

#How to run it (mandatory part only)

Using make test will make and run the mandatory part.

You can also use make to generate the cub3D executable. You can launch it with ./cub3D.

Controls (mandatory part only)
Controls are the same as the project with bonuses, but only W A S D to move and ← → to turn are available.
