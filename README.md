# Cub3D

First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).

## How to run it

Using make bonus will build the executable ./cub3D.

```bash
make bonus
```
To run it again without remaking, you can simply run the executable.

```bash
./Cub3D Bonus/map_bonus.cub
```

## Controls

* To exit the game, press ESC or click the red cross.
